# Welcome to my website! 

Hi! I am Amanda Kristanto and this is my Github website! This website is a summary of what I have done academically and professionally. 

I am currently a University of California, San Diego Computer Science Senior and transferred from Santa Monica College. I have taken a wide variety of courses including: 

* Accelarated Introduction to Programming in Java
* Basic Data Structures and Object Oriented Design in Java 
* Computer Organization and System Programs (Assembly and C)
* Software Tools and Techniques - [Link  to lab reports](https://ajkristanto.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/index.html)
* Discrete Mathematics
* Theory of Computation
* Engineering Probability and Statitics


I am currently taking: 
* Advanced Data Structures in C++ 
* Digital Systems 
* Teaching Computational Thinking for Everyone - [Link to my teaching portfolio website]([https://ajkristanto.github.io/teaching-portfolio/](https://ajkristanto.github.io/teaching-portfolio/index.html))
* Teaching Computation in the Digital World

I also participated in a program that introduces CSE graduates to research called the ERSP program. In this program we were divided into teams to conduct a year long research project alongside a professor and graduate students. My team and I researched on how to make inverse rendering operations more efficient to fit on a mobile device by implementing MobileNet.
